This analysis is for a worm that was released in 2003 called SQL slammer


The actual worm itself isn't as interesting as the vulnerability it exploits. 

There is an unprotect string copy that allows for a buffer overflow in the Microsoft SQL Server July 2002 update. A combination of this buffer overflow and abusing the fact that there is an uncalled "jump esp" function in the sqlsort dll allow the worm to exploit over the internet to any SQL Server Services listening on a certain port.
