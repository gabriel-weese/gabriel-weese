This is a disassembly of the DOS7.419 virus. 

The virus is primarily an example of anti-debugger techniques including self-modifying code and interrupt hijacking. There are no real consequences of the virus, other than some changes to the terminal environment. The only true consequences stem from attempting to debug it, in which case the virus will zero out the first inserted floppy.
